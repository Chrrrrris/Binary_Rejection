# Binary_Rejection
This repo performs the rejection of unresolved binaries.
By inputting the cluster name in the main function, a CSV file containing the parameters of the actual main sequence stars would be generated.

To perform the rejection, in the main file:
1.Edit the directory of the source files
2.Edit the name of the cluster
3.Edit the csv file name you want to output
